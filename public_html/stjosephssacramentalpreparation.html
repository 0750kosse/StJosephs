      <p class="section-content_text">St Joseph’s runs a programme of preparation for Baptised children who belong to,
        and worship in, the parish
        and are over the age of 7 years and in Year 3 or above in our catholic primary school. Children not attending
        catholic schools are also most welcome to enrol in our programme.

        Application forms are available in September and are available from the Parish Office. Sessions begin in
        October. These are led by a team of experienced catechists, all of whom are DBS checked. Parents are their
        children’s primary teachers in the ways of the faith and, as such, our programme is designed to assist them in
        this wonderful privileged journey of preparing their children for the sacraments.</p>

        in Catholic Schools who are
        in year 10 or above in September are eligible to register for our parish Confirmation programme. Young people
        not attending Catholic schools are also welcome to enrol.

        Confirmation sessions for candidates take place on Sunday evenings at 5.30 pm. Parents are required to attend
        the launch meeting only. Sessions begin in October. The sessions are led by experienced catechists, all of
        whom are DBS checked.

        Participants must be Baptised Catholics, who have made their First Holy Communion. Candidates are required to
        attend weekly Mass and perform a minimum of ten hours of Parish Service as part of the programme.

        Enrolment forms are available from the Parish Office in September.
