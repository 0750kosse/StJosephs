    <h2 class="section-content_title">St. Joseph's Church History</h2>
    <p class="section-content_text">St.Joseph’s was established in 1858, at a time when the
      relaxation of legal
      control over Catholicism was taking place. The Catholic community was expanding because of the railroads, but
      there was still considerable suspicion, resentment and open prejudice from the largely Protestant population of
      London, and indeed Highgate.</p>

      <img class="section-content_image" alt="Father Ignatius Spencer" src="css/wpimages/wp1faeb524_05_06.jpg"
        loading="lazy">
      <figcaption class="section-content_image-caption">Fr Ignatius Spencer</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="section-content_text">When Father Ignatius Spencer was seeking a home for the Passionists in London, the
      Old Black Dog
      Inn at Highgate seemed suitable, but could only be inspected by subterfuge. The Priests visited the property in
      disguise so they would be unrecognised – less than 10 years previously the owner had refused to sell the property
      as he dreamed that it would be bought by Papists, and at this time there had been an anti-<wbr>Catholic riot in Highgate High Street.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content_text">Buying the property at auction was only the first of the problems to be overcome, as
      the
      acquisition and construction needed to be funded, and at that time the funds did not exist!</p>
    <p class="section-content_text">Father Ignatius approached his nephew, the fifth Earl Spencer (the great, great
      uncle of Diana,
      Princess of Wales), to seek funds. The fifth Earl recommenced an annuity of £300 pa, which had been withheld by
      the family when the Honourable and Reverend George Spencer now known as Fr Ignatius had converted to Catholicism.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content_text">Although Father Ignatius died in 1864 and did not see his work come to fruition, the
      local
      Catholic community grew rapidly, and a chapel attached to the old pub was replaced by a purpose built church in
      1861, but even this became too small and so the work of building the current St. Joseph’s commenced on 24th May
      1888. The construction was overseen by the enthusiastic Brother Alphonsus Zeegers, working in habit and
      stonemason’s apron.</p>
    <p class="section-content_text">On the evening of 21st November 1889 the new church building was blessed by the
      Bishop of
      Liverpool, but this triumph for the community was matched by a burden of debt that would not be repaid for a
      further 43 years. On 28th April 1932, the debt having been finally cleared by the efforts of the community the
      church was finally consecrated.</p>
